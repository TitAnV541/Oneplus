             7. Special protection plans<br></p>
			<p style="color:black;font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size:16px;font-style:bold;">
             OnePlus knows that even the best phones are prone to drops and accidents. Having the fastest processor or 8 GB RAM on your mobile will not prevent 
             it from being damaged if it falls on the floor or into a steaming bowl of soup. Keeping this in mind, OnePlus offers extended protection plans that
             will continue to take care of your device long after the standard warranty period is over. These plans cover damages due to drops, breakages and liquids.
             Opting for one of these plans is a sure-shot way of keeping your OnePlus mobile safe and sound.<br></p>
