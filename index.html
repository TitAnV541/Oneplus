             also comes with a Qualcomm SM8250 Snapdragon 865 5G processor and an Adreno 650 GPU, which is a powerhouse in itself. All OnePlus phones offer a wide 
             range of connectivity options, so you never have to worry about keeping in sync with the world around you.<br>
             3. Top-notch cameras<br>
